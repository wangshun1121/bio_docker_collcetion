# (Pathway Mapper)[https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/pathway-mapper]

To delopy Pathway Mapper, using docker can be very easy:

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 wangshun1121/pathway-mapper:v2.2.1 
```

then Pathway Mapper can be used in your web brownser: `http:/127.0.0.1:3000` .

* Not all browners can make sure Pathway Mapper can be run properly. In my macbook, it can work well in Google Chrome, but failed in Safari.
